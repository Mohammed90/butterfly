Flutter ported to HTML DOM, which makes it a:

- Object-oriented
- Widget-based (i.e. component-based)
- Reactive
- Web framework
- For Dart
- Inspired by Flutter (transitively by ReactJS)

Some reasons why you might like it:

- **Familiar**: if you have prior Flutter/ReactJS experience you will feel right
  at home.
- **Reusable**: while not API compatible with Flutter (on purpose), the
  component system is identical, which means you can reuse most of your app's
  business logic, data model and utilities across mobile and web. More
  importantly, you will be using the same Dart toolchain (language, libraries,
  IDE, pub).
- **Simple**: unlike traditional web frameworks there's only one sane modern
  language to write your code in - Dart
- **Small**: starting application size is <40kb (minified + gzipped)
- **Fast**: while it's hard to compare frameworks in terms of raw speed, this
  framework does aim to give you great levels of control for efficient
  incremental UI updates.
- **Composable**: works like a library - drop it into an existing app; it shares
  all the same Dart libraries so the incremental cost of adding it to your
  project is minimal.
- **Layered**: made of layers (widgets, tree, DOM) - you choose how low-level to
  go.
- **Dart**: a sane language that scales from small apps to large enterprise
  projects.
